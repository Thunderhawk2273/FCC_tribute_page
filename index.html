                <li><strong>August 1934</strong> – USAAC (United States Army Air Corps) tendered a proposal for a multiengine bomober to replace the Martin B-10.</li>
                <li><strong>July 1935</strong> – First test flight of the Model 299 with Boeing chief test pilot Leslie Tower at the controls. The term "Flying Fortress" is coined by <i>The Seattle Times</i> reporter, Richard Williams.<br><br>Boeing was quick to to trademark the name for use.</li>
                <li><strong>August 1935</strong> – Prototype flew from Seattle to Wright Field in nine hours and 3 minutes, with an average cruising speed of 252 mph, much faster than the competition.</li>
                <li><strong>October 1935</strong> – During the second evaluation flight, Major Ployer Peter Hill and Leslie Tower forget to disengate the "gust locks", causing the plane to rapidly, climb, stall, and crash. Hill and Tower did not survive; other observers on the plane managed to survive with injuries.<br><br>While the crash disqualified the Model 299 from competition, the air corps was still enthusiastic about the aircraft's potential.</li>
                <li><strong>January 1936</strong> – Through a legal loophole, the USAAC ordered 13 YB-17s.</li>
                <li><strong>March - August 1937</strong> – 12 of the 13 Y1B-17s were delivered to the 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field in Virgina. A suggestion adopted was the use of a pre-flight checklist checklist to avoid accidents such as that which befell the Model 299.<br><br>The 13th Y1B-17 was used for flight testing at the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio. Experiments on this aircraft led to the use of a quartet of General Electric turbo-superchargers, which would become standard on the B-17 line.<br><br>A 14th aircraft, the YB-17A, originally destined for ground testing only and upgraded with the turbochargers, was redesignated B-17A after testing had finsihed.</li>
                <li><strong>1937 - 1943</strong> – Over many redesigns later, the model B-17F was the typical type of bomber facing the Germans in 1943.</li>
                <li><strong>1945</strong> – By the end of World War 2, the B-17G was in service. </li>
            </ul>
